Two files connected through transmission control protocol. Input takes in keystrokes for direction and speed. Speed is converted to PWM and then outputted along with the direction. Pynput package detects when the keys have been pressed and released. The direction and speed is then encoded in utf=8 and sent to the server. The server decodes it and then outputs it to the terminal.
